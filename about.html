            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>I'm Manukrishna J P, a Computer Science student specializing in Cybersecurity at Amrita Vishwa
                Vidyapeetham.</p>

            <p>My journey in tech started with a curiosity about how systems work and how they can be protected. This
                curiosity evolved into a strong passion for networking, system security, and software development,
                leading me to explore tools, techniques, and programming languages like Python and C.</p>

            <p>I’m particularly passionate about building secure, efficient, and reliable applications. Whether it’s
                developing a password vault, exploring honeypots, or working on network protocols, I enjoy creating
                solutions that contribute to a safer digital world.</p>

            <p>Outside of academics, I love exploring Linux, working on cybersecurity projects, solving real-world
                problems, and staying updated on emerging threats and technologies in the security landscape.</p>

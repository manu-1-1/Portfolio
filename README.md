# My Portfolio

A personal portfolio site I built to put everything in one place — who I am, what I've worked on, and how to reach me.

## What's inside

- **Home** – quick intro and a download link for my CV
- **About** – my background, education, skills, and certifications
- **Projects** – things I've actually built, with a short description and links to the repos
- **Contact** – a form to reach me directly

## Tech

Plain HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. No frameworks, no build step — just open `index.html` in a browser and it works.

## Projects featured

**Nuclear Launch Code Simulation** — a cybersecurity project built around the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The idea is to split a secret into multiple shares so that only specific combinations can reconstruct it. It's a simplified but functional demonstration of how real-world cryptographic secret splitting works. Written in C++ with a small HTML/CSS/JS frontend.

**This portfolio** — the site itself. Responsive layout, smooth animations, clean navigation.

## Running locally

No setup needed. Clone the repo and open `index.html` directly, or serve it with something like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code if you want hot reload.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manu-1-1/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio
# open index.html in your browser
```
